## Saloua Raouda Choucair
(1916 - 2017) was a Lebanese abstract painter and sculptor. Informed by her interest across several fields such as quantum physics and Arabic poetry, Choucair’s abstract-expressionist works combined principles of Islamic art, science, mathematics, and she produced paintings, sculptures, architectural plans, jewelry and other abstracted objects.

* combo of strict grid + organic sinousoidal curves
* from Blue Form 1935 synopsis
> " 'so clear and so serene' and 'so precise and so exuberant' it could be seen as gay science"

### takeaways
* generative w/ contstraints
	* gemoetric repetition on a grid, conforms to strict rules of balance, harmony, rhythm
* not everything has to strictly conform to said rules. A lot of her pieces didn't feature obvious or explicit use of strict pure design yet still had overall harmony
