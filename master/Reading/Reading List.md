In Edith Young's Color Scheme, the color palette becomes a vehicle to examine art history, popular culture, and the artist's own professional and artistic development....The primary allure...is Young’s artwork and methodology, but the writing, at times both humorous and sophisticated, will get you to stay.

### Lurking: How a Person Became a User
#### by Joanne McNeil

![43565344](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1553563781l/43565344.jpg)

In _Lurking_, Joanne McNeil digs deep and identifies the primary (if sometimes contradictory) concerns of people online: searching, safety, privacy, identity, community, anonymity, and visibility. She charts what it is that brought people online and what keeps us here even as the social equations of digital life—what we’re made to trade, knowingly or otherwise, for the benefits of the internet—have shifted radically beneath us. It is a story we are accustomed to hearing as tales of entrepreneurs and visionaries and dynamic and powerful corporations, but there is a more profound, intimate story that hasn’t yet been told.

### Camgirls: Celebrity and Community in the Age of Social Networks
#### by Theresa Senft

![3279897](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1358755367l/3279897.jpg)

This book is a critical and ethnographic study of camgirls: women who broadcast themselves over the web for the general public while trying to cultivate a measure of celebrity in the process. The book's over-arching question is, «What does it mean for feminists to speak about the personal as political in a networked society that encourages women to 'represent' through confession, celebrity, and sexual display, but punishes too much visibility with conservative censure and backlash? 

The narrative follows that of the camgirl phenomenon, beginning with the earliest experiments in personal homecamming and ending with the newest forms of identity and community being articulated through social networking sites like Live Journal, YouTube, MySpace, and Facebook. It is grounded in interviews, performance analysis of events transpiring between camgirls and their viewers, and the author's own experiences as an ersatz camgirl while conducting the research.

### Cybertypes: Race, Ethnicity, and Identity on the Internet
#### by Lisa Nakamura

![1006471](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348832277l/1006471.jpg)

Defying a generation of scholars who have argued that there's no place for race in cyberspace, Lisa Nakamura sets out to find and analyze the cultural work that race and ethnicity do online. Traveling through a fascinating web of online nodes and offline narratives--advertisements for Microsoft and MCI, MUDs, and commercially-driven Web sites, and cyberpunk films and novels, to name a few--Nakamura deftly and engagingly shows us that race happens, both online and within popular discourses portraying online culture.

### From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism
#### by Fred Turner

![5592](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1361798141l/5592.jpg)

In the early 1960s, computers haunted the American popular imagination. Bleak tools of the cold war, they embodied the rigid organization and mechanical conformity that made the military-industrial complex possible. But by the 1990s—and the dawn of the Internet—computers started to represent a very different kind of world: a collaborative and digital utopia modeled on the communal ideals of the hippies who so vehemently rebelled against the cold war establishment in the first place.
