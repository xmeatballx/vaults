## Status
* add status if you step away
* you can add general things if necessary so brian and lisa know where project is at
* keep status logs in subtasks and main project

## Changing status
* switch to in progress immediately when starting something
* dev ready is seen as "never been touched"
* if lisa finds issues that need fixing she will move to edits requested and developer should move to in progress

## Don't put anything in functions.php!!!!
* use a code snippets plugin instead
