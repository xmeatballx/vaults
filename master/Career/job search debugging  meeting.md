What is the root of your problem?
	
	Unsure. Feel in the dark due to rejection without feedback even after a round or two of interviews.	

My current approach...
	
	Applying to junior front end jobs at agencies. Try to find smaller companies. Looking mostly on Indeed, LinkedIn, and Otta.

Resume
	* not making it through ATS
	* content: frequency of keywords, density
	* starting with skills doesn't translate to non-technical interviewers
	* comprehensive summary include soft skills and accomplishments to appeal to non-technical interviewers 
	* do market analysis in local area. compare job descriptions and copy language/skills exactly
	* break up skills into languages, libraries, frameworks, databases
	*  talk more about education
	* freelance looks bad (placeholder for unemployment) 

Phone Screen 
	* non-technical => behavioral => technical

LinkedIn
	* 

Transitioning industries
	
	Currently cooking at a high volume restaurant. 
	Learned many career skills from cooking such as communication, organization, attention to detail and quality of work.
	Not sure if acknowledging that would help or hurt in interviews.
